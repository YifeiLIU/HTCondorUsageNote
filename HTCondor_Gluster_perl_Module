Background: 
	running R package which call Perl scripts and the perl scripts will use Perl Module, such as Statistics::Descriptive.
Problem: 
	On the HTCondor, only the basic Perl is installed without any Perl Module.
Solution:
	Install Perl and Perl Module on Gluster. Usually the Perl will be automatically installed under the /home. Module, on the other hand, can be installed locally. Here Perl Module must be installed locally as I do not have authorization to install under root. 
Basically, there are two ways to install the Modules: manually and using "cpan". See: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/how-to-install-perl-modules-manually-and-using-cpan-command/
"cpan" is usually more efficient as most of the modules requires many prerequisites and it will be troublesome to install manually. However, "cpan" need to be installed under the root = =.....and I only need the Statistics:Descriptive Module so I choose to install manually.
Since we change the default path to install the Module and the upper level module will search for the dependences modules. How to tell the upper level module where is its dependency. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9133532/perl-prerequisites-on-local-install. In it, there are two key points: 1. perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/lib LIB=~/lib 2. export PERL5LIB=~/lib:$PERL5LIB.

Then the module is installed at ~/lib **\^-^/**

	Before running R scripts. Extend the perl library path by "export PERL5LIB=~/lib:$PERL5LIB".

Tips:
condor_submit -i (i means interaction) file.submit      can go to the excutable node.
instmodsh    can list the perl module on that server.

If we cannot run "export PERL5LIB=~/lib:$PERL5LIB" directly on the server terminal, we can add the perl module lib using R command: Sys.setenv(PERL5LIB="/mnt/gluster/yzheng74/Softwares/perl/Module/lib/") before the R command.
